# happy

There are tons of writings about happiness. I am going to add my share to it. Only difference here is that, I am going to talk about my own experience.

As I mentioned elsewhere, I grew up in a rural villege. Then I moved to a messy smelly city. From there I moved to a suburban town in North America.

I have stayed in a hut. I have slept on the side of a street. I have slept on a Indian railway platform. I have slept in open terrus. I have slept in well furnished appartments and houses. I have slept in 5 and 7 star hotels.
